      description: |

        Role for the mongod server in the Mongodb cluster: 'rs' for replica set, 'sa' for stand alone server
        In the future, 'cfg' (for config server), 'sh' (for shard server) will
        also be supported.

  port:
      default: 27017
      description: Default mongodb port for replicasets AND standalone server

  storage_engine:
      default: wiredTiger
      description: |
        The storage engine for the mongod database.
        Use "mmapv1" to specify the MMAPv1 storage engine.
        Use "wiredTiger" to specify the WiredTiger storage engine.
        Use "rocksdb" to specify the RocksDB storage engine.

        Here the "inMemory" engine is not supported.

        Ref: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#storage.engine
  mmap_v1_small_files:
      default: "false"
      description: |
        When 'true', MongoDB uses a smaller default file size. This option
        reduces the initial size for data files and limits the maximum size to
        512 megabytes. When "true", the size of each journal file will also be
        reduced from 1 GB to 128 MB. Use this option if you have a large number
        of databases that each holds a small quantity of data.

        Setting this to "true" can lead the mongod instance to create a large
        number of files, which can affect performance for larger databases.

        Ref: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#storage.mmapv1.smallFiles
  wired_tiger_cache_size_gb:
      default: null
      description: |
        The maximum size of the internal cache that WiredTiger will use for all
        data. Values can range from 256MB to 10TB and can be a float.

        The default WiredTiger internal cache size value assumes that there is a
        single mongod instance per machine. If a single machine contains
        multiple MongoDB instances, then you should decrease the setting to
        accommodate the other mongod instances.

        Ref: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#storage.wiredTiger.engineConfig.cacheSizeGB
  slow_query_threshold_ms:
      default: 100
      description: |
        The threshold in milliseconds at which the database profiler considers a
        query slow. MongoDB records all slow queries to the log, even when the
        database profiler is off. When the profiler is on, it writes to the
        'system.profile' collection.

        Ref: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#operationProfiling.slowOpThresholdMs
  replication.enable:
      default: 1
      description: |
        When set to 1, this settings activates replication.
  replication.replica_set_name:
      default: rs0
      description: |
        The name of the replica set that the mongod is part of. All hosts in the
        replica set must have the same set name.

        If your application connects to more than one replica set, each set
        should have a distinct name. Some drivers group replica set connections
        by replica set name.

        Ref: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#replication.replSetName
  replication.operation_log_max_size_mb:
      default: 256
      description: |
        The maximum size in megabytes for the replication operation log (i.e.,
        the oplog). The mongod process creates an oplog based on the maximum
        amount of space available. For 64-bit systems, the oplog is typically 5%
        of available disk space. Once the mongod has created the oplog for the
        first time, changing the this maximum size option will not affect the
        size of the oplog.

        Ref: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#replication.oplogSizeMB
  replication.key:
      description: |
        Specify key which will be used in keyfile. Mandatory for replication
        without ssl With keyfile authentication, each mongod instances in the
        replica set uses the contents of the keyfile as the shared password
        for authenticating other members in the deployment. Only mongod
        instances with the correct keyfile can join the replica set.

        The content of the keyfile must be between 6 and 1024 characters long
        and must be the same for all members of the replica set.
  enable_role_based_access_control:
      default: 1
      description: |
        When set to '1', this option enables Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to
        govern each userâ€™s access to database resources and operations. In such
        case, a user can access only the database resources and actions for
        which they have been granted privileges.

        When set to any other value, all users can access any database and
        perform any action. This is meant to be done in development environments
        only. Never disable this option in production.

  admin_username:
      default: MongoAdmin
      description: |
        Username of the default admin user.
  admin_password:
      description: |
        Password for the admin user, in clear text.
  root_username:
      default: MongoRoot
      description: |
        Username of the default root user.
  root_password:

  server_certificate:

        ca: "NOT INITIALIZED"
        private_key: "NOT INITIALIZED"
        certificate: "NOT INITIALIZED"
      description: Mongodb certificate for ttl/ssl auth
  require_ssl:
      default: 1
      description: |
        Enforce TLS/SSL for connecting to the server.

        When this options is set to '1', all connections to mongod must be
        encrypted with TLS/SSL, and un-encrypted connections will be refused.
        For example, when using the 'mongo' client, the '--ssl' argument will be
        mandatory.

        When this options is set to '0', then all connections to mongod must not
        be encrypted, and SSL/TLS will not be possible. For example, when using
        the 'mongo' client, the '--ssl' argument will not be possible. This
        should be reserved to development environments and be avoided in
        production.
  arbiter_only:
      default: no
      example: yes
      description: |
        Have the node be an arbitrer only, and hold no database (when set to
        'yes').

        This option overrides any value set to 'mongodb.mmap_v1_small_files' and
        'mongodb.replication.operation_log_max_size_mb'.
